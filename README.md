# Project_PCII

### Scope of the project
This project was developed as part of the curriculum of the subject of Computer Programming II. We were asked to develop an application using classes and the tkinter module for the interface.
The final classification of our project was 19 values (out of 20).

### Our idea
Our project proposal was to develop a platform to rent private planes and jets, which we named AVILUX. 

### Classes
The classes relation follow this structure:
  -Pilot and Staff inherit from Employee, and Employee and Client inherit from User;
  -Model is airplane parent class;
  -Reservation establishes the relation between Client and Airplane classes.

### Tkinter
As stated before, the interface obtained using the tkinter module. We constructed several forms, with the starting one being "Start" and "Mainwindow" being the connection to most of the others.
There are other libraries that need to be imported, such as PIL for the images, and pandas and matplotlib for the statistics menu. This is the main window for the employees.
